Python is a programming language -  beginner friendly
We use programming language to stablish rules or instructions to a computer.

A string is a data type that consist of text. 

Examples of strings = 

print("Hello, World")
output : Hello World

When we print strings we can use double quotes or single quotes.

Example of single quotes string = 

print('Hello World')
output : Hello World

We can also use multiple line strings by using tripe quotes

Example of tripe quotes strings = 

print("""This is an example of a 
triple string. We can continue to tell 
more in multiple lines and have it as a string""")

We can use new line and concatenate with strings + and \n
